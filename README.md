## Overview

This repository documents my journey transitioning from macOS to Linux (Arch and NixOS) as a professional software engineer. It serves as both personal documentation and a structured learning path for others interested in gaining deep Linux proficiency.

### Philosophy

This project is built on these core principles:

- **Mastery Through Deliberate Practice**: Regular, focused practice of specific skills
- **Progressive Skill Acquisition**: Learn fundamentals before moving to advanced concepts
- **Deep Understanding Over Surface Knowledge**: Thoroughly understand each component of the system
- **Career-Oriented Learning**: Focus on skills that provide a professional advantage
- **Documentation as Learning**: Capture knowledge acquisition in real-time

## System Architecture

This repository includes:

1. **Installation Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for Arch Linux and NixOS setup
2. **Configuration Files**: My personal dotfiles and system configurations
3. **Learning Path**: A structured, month-by-month curriculum for mastering Linux
4. **Problem Solutions**: Documented solutions to challenges encountered
5. **Development Environment**: Configuration for Python, JavaScript, and Ruby development
6. **Career Applications**: How these skills apply to software engineering and ML/finance roles

```

## Getting Started

If you're following along with this journey, start here:

1. Read the [installation guide](installation/arch/README.md) for detailed setup instructions
2. Follow the [Month 1 Guide](learning_guides/month-01-base-system.md) to establish your foundation
3. Progress through each monthly guide as your skills and confidence grow

## Time Commitment

This learning path is designed to be completed in 12 months with approximately 10-15 hours of study per week. The breakdown of time investment is:

- **Initial Setup**: 3-7 days of focused work
- **Adaptation Phase**: 2-4 weeks of regular use and customization
- **Proficiency**: 3-6 months of continued learning and practice
- **Mastery**: Ongoing development beyond the core curriculum

## Key Tools and Technologies

- **Operating Systems**: Arch Linux and NixOS
- **Window Managers**: i3wm, Sway, or Hyprland
- **Shell**: Zsh with Oh My Zsh
- **Terminal Multiplexer**: Tmux
- **Editor**: Neovim
- **Development**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby environments
- **Containers**: Docker, Podman
- **System Management**: Systemd, Nix

## Why This Approach

This repository represents a career-oriented approach to Linux mastery. Rather than learning disjointed concepts, this structured path builds skills systematically, with each month building on the previous one.

The combination of Arch Linux (for deep understanding) and NixOS (for declarative configuration) provides both breadth and depth of Linux knowledge that can significantly enhance a software engineering career.
