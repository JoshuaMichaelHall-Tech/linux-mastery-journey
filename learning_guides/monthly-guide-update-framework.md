   - Time commitment statement

2. **Visual Learning Path**
   - Add a visual flow diagram showing the progression of topics through the 4 weeks
   - Example format:
   ```
   Week 1                 Week 2                 Week 3                 Week 4
   ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
   │  Topic 1    │       │  Topic 2    │       │  Topic 3    │       │  Topic 4    │
   │  Focus      │──────▶│  Focus      │──────▶│  Focus      │──────▶│  Focus      │
   │  Area       │       │  Area       │       │  Area       │       │  Area       │
   └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘       └─────────────┘
