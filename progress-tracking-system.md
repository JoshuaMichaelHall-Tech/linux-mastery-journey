## Progress Dashboard Setup

Create a visual dashboard to track your progress. This can be implemented using several methods based on your preferences.

### Command-Line Dashboard

Create a shell script that generates a text-based dashboard:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# progress-dashboard.sh

PROGRESS_DIR="$HOME/.linux-mastery/progress"
SKILL_MATRIX="$PROGRESS_DIR/skill-matrix.csv"
PROJECTS_DIR="$PROGRESS_DIR/projects"
MONTHLY_LOGS="$PROGRESS_DIR/monthly-logs"

# Create progress directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$PROGRESS_DIR"
mkdir -p "$PROJECTS_DIR" 
mkdir -p "$MONTHLY_LOGS"

# Create skill matrix if it doesn't exist
if [ ! -f "$SKILL_MATRIX" ]; then
    echo "Skill,Category,Proficiency,Evidence,Date,Notes" > "$SKILL_MATRIX"
    echo "Creating new skill matrix at $SKILL_MATRIX"
fi

# Calculate overall progress
if [ -f "$SKILL_MATRIX" ]; then
    TOTAL_SKILLS=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | wc -l)
    SKILLS_WITH_PROFICIENCY=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep -v ",,," | wc -l)
    
    if [ $TOTAL_SKILLS -gt 0 ]; then
        PROGRESS_PCT=$((SKILLS_WITH_PROFICIENCY * 100 / TOTAL_SKILLS))
    else
        PROGRESS_PCT=0
    fi
    
    # Count skills by proficiency level
    LVL0=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep ",0," | wc -l)
    LVL1=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep ",1," | wc -l)
    LVL2=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep ",2," | wc -l)
    LVL3=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep ",3," | wc -l)
    LVL4=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep ",4," | wc -l)
    LVL5=$(grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | grep ",5," | wc -l)
else
    PROGRESS_PCT=0
    TOTAL_SKILLS=0
    SKILLS_WITH_PROFICIENCY=0
    LVL0=0
    LVL1=0
    LVL2=0
    LVL3=0
    LVL4=0
    LVL5=0
fi

# Count completed projects
COMPLETED_PROJECTS=$(find "$PROJECTS_DIR" -name "*.md" | wc -l)

# Count monthly logs
COMPLETED_MONTHS=$(find "$MONTHLY_LOGS" -name "month-*.md" | wc -l)

# Display dashboard

echo "================================================================="
echo "               LINUX MASTERY JOURNEY PROGRESS                    "
echo "================================================================="
echo ""
echo "Overall Progress: $PROGRESS_PCT% ($SKILLS_WITH_PROFICIENCY/$TOTAL_SKILLS skills tracked)"
echo ""
echo "Skill Proficiency Breakdown:"
echo "  Level 0 (None):        $LVL0"
echo "  Level 1 (Awareness):   $LVL1"
echo "  Level 2 (Beginner):    $LVL2"

echo "Completed Monthly Modules: $COMPLETED_MONTHS/12"
echo ""
echo "================================================================="
echo "Recent Activity:"

# Show recent updates to the skill matrix (last 5)
if [ -f "$SKILL_MATRIX" ]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Recently Updated Skills:"
    grep -v "^Skill" "$SKILL_MATRIX" | sort -t, -k5 -r | head -5 | while IFS=, read -r skill category prof evidence date notes; do
        if [ ! -z "$date" ]; then
            echo "  [$date] $skill - Level $prof"
        fi
    done
fi

# Show most recent project
LATEST_PROJECT=$(find "$PROJECTS_DIR" -name "*.md" -type f -printf "%T@ %p\n" | sort -nr | head -1 | cut -d' ' -f2-)
if [ ! -z "$LATEST_PROJECT" ]; then
    echo ""

echo "Next Steps Recommendations:"

# Recommend based on skill gaps
echo "  1. Focus on skills with lowest proficiency levels"
echo "  2. Complete monthly log for current period"
if [ $COMPLETED_PROJECTS -lt 3 ]; then
    echo "  3. Add more projects to your portfolio"
fi
echo "  4. Run 'skill-update' to record new skills"

echo ""
echo "================================================================="
```

Make it executable and install:

```bash
chmod +x progress-dashboard.sh
sudo cp progress-dashboard.sh /usr/local/bin/progress-dashboard
```

### Web-Based Dashboard (Optional)

For a more visual approach, create a simple HTML dashboard using a static site generator or plain HTML/CSS/JS.

Example structure:

```
dashboard/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── js/
│   └── dashboard.js
└── data/
    ├── skills.json
    ├── projects.json
    └── monthly-logs.json
```

Sample JavaScript to load and display data:

```javascript
// dashboard.js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Load skill data
    fetch('data/skills.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            updateSkillChart(data);
            updateSkillTable(data);
        });

    // Load project data
    fetch('data/projects.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            updateProjectList(data);
        });

    // Load monthly log data
    fetch('data/monthly-logs.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            updateMonthlyProgress(data);
        });
});

function updateSkillChart(data) {
    // Implement chart visualization using Chart.js or similar
}

function updateSkillTable(data) {
    // Populate skill table with data
}

function updateProjectList(data) {
    // Show project list and completion status
}

function updateMonthlyProgress(data) {
    // Display monthly progress as a timeline
}
```

## Implementation Guide

sudo cp skill-update.sh /usr/local/bin/skill-update
```

### 4. Integrate with Existing Workflow

Add tracking as part of your regular study routine:

1. After completing each guide section, update relevant skills
2. At the end of each week, update the monthly progress log
3. After completing projects, document them in the portfolio
4. At the end of each month, review progress and plan next steps
5. After completing each phase, perform certification self-assessment

### 5. Regular Reviews

Schedule regular reviews of your progress:

1. **Weekly Reviews**: Quick check of skills practiced and progress toward monthly goals
2. **Monthly Reviews**: Comprehensive review of completed work and certification progress
3. **Quarterly Reviews**: Deep review of overall trajectory and adjustment of learning plan

## Acknowledgements
