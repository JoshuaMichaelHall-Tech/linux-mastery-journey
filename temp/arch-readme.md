# Arch Linux Installation Guide

This directory contains guides and resources for installing and configuring Arch Linux as a professional development environment. The installation process is designed to provide a solid foundation for software development with a focus on Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

## Installation Options

This guide provides two installation approaches:

1. **Standard Installation**: A detailed, step-by-step manual installation process that provides deep understanding of the system components.
2. **Automated Installation**: Script-assisted installation for faster deployment with predefined configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation, ensure you have:

- A computer with at least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended for development)
- At least 20GB free disk space (50GB+ recommended)
- Backed up any important data
- A USB drive (4GB+) for creating installation media
- Internet connection (wired connection recommended for installation)
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Installation Media Preparation

1. Download the latest Arch Linux ISO from the [official website](https://archlinux.org/download/)
2. Create a bootable USB using one of these methods:
   ```bash
   # On Linux
   dd bs=4M if=path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync
   
   # On macOS
   dd if=path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/rdiskX bs=1m
   ```

## Installation Overview

The installation process consists of these main phases:

1. **Pre-Installation**: Boot preparation, network setup, disk partitioning
2. **Base Installation**: Installing the base system and essential packages
3. **System Configuration**: Localization, bootloader, users, networking
4. **Post-Installation**: Desktop environment, development tools, customization

## Post-Installation

After completing the base installation, refer to these resources for further configuration:

1. [Month 1 Learning Guide](../learning_guides/month-01-base-system.md) for deepening your understanding of the base system
2. [Desktop Environment Setup](../configuration/desktop/README.md) for customizing your desktop experience
3. [Development Workflow Guide](../configuration/development/README.md) for optimizing your development environment

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](../../troubleshooting/README.md) for common problems and solutions. The guide includes specific sections for:

- Boot issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Graphics driver configuration
- Package management issues

## Contributing

If you find improvements for the installation process or configurations, please see the [Contributing Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to submit changes.

## Acknowledgements

This guide was developed with assistance from Anthropic's Claude AI assistant, which helped with:
- Documentation organization
- Installation step sequencing
- Troubleshooting guidance

Claude was used as a development aid while all final implementation decisions and verification were performed by Joshua Michael Hall.
